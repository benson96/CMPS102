# CMPS102
Methods for the systematic construction and mathematical analysis of algorithms. Order notation, the RAM model of computation, lower bounds, and recurrence relations are covered. The algorithm design techniques include divide-and-conquer, branch and bound, and dynamic programming. Applications to combinatorial, graph, string, and geometric algorithms.
